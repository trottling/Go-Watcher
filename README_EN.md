**Go-Watcher** is a lightweight security tool written in Go that monitors suspicious activity and blocks it.

_This repository is a test task for an internship at CyberOK_

## Key features

- **Real-time Nginx log monitoring**: Go-Watcher continuously monitors Nginx access logs for suspicious requests.
- **Attack Detection**: Using customizable rules and regular expressions, Go-Watcher can identify various types of attacks, such as:
- Port Scans
- SQL Injections
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Brute Force
- **IP Blocking**: When suspicious activity is detected, Go-Watcher can automatically block the attacker's IP address by adding it to the Nginx blacklist.
- **Flexible Configuration**: You can configure Go-Watcher to:
- Monitor specific paths
- Ignore specific IP addresses
- Detection sensitivity settings
- **Event Logging**: Go-Watcher keeps a detailed log of all detected events, including:
- Date and time
- Attacker's IP address
- Blocked URL
- Attack type
- **Ease of Use**: Go-Watcher is easy to configure and use, making it accessible even for novice users.
